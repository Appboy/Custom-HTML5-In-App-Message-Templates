# Email Capture
<img src="/_images/web-email-capture.png" width="250">

This template provides an email capture in-app message, similar to the email capture type available on the Appboy dashboard, but provided as raw HTML to allow for deeper customization.

A close button (x) is provided in the upper right hand corner.  (Note: A close button action must always be included in your HTML to allow users to dismiss your in-app message. Ex: ```<a href="#/" onclick="appboyBridge.closeMessage()">Close</a>```)
